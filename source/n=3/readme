The files in this folder consist of results for n=3:

1)pos_sets.txt:
	Consists of 101 distinct functions (positive)

2)neg_sets.txt:
	Consists of 101 distinct functions (negative)

3)neg_all.txt:
	All those combinations of three functions that yield a complete graph with negative edges
	Total: 101(C)3 = 166650

4)pos_all.txt:
	All those combinations of three functions that yield a complete graph with positive edges
	Total: 101(C)3 = 166650

5)neg_cyc.txt:

7)common_txt:
	Boolean functions which occur in both pos_sets.txt and neg_sets.txt
	Total: 50

8)cycle_analysis_pos:
	Determine the count of the positive cycles found in pos_cyc.txt by their cycle length and also separate them into equivalence
	classes along with the functions contained in them and their cardinality

9)cycle_analysis_neg:
	Determine the count of the positive cycles found in neg_cyc.txt by their cycle length and also separate them into equivalence
	classes along with the functions contained in them and their cardinality
